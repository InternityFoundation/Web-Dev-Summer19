Basic Selectors

CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.

Type selectors:
The CSS type selector matches elements by node name. In other words, it selects all elements of the given type within a document.

Syntax
element { style properties }

Class selectors:
The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute.

Syntax
.class_name { style properties }

ID selectors:
The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of its id attribute. In order for the element to be selected, its ID attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.

Syntax
#id_value { style properties }

Universal selectors:
The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type.

Syntax
* { style properties }

Attribute selectors:
The CSS attribute selector matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute.

[attr=value]=Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is exactly value.

[attr~=value] = Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly value.
