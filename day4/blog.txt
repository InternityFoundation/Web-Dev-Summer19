The <input> Element
The <input> element is the most important form element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

<input type=”text”> : Defines a one-line text input field

<input type=”radio”> : Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)

<input type=”submit”> : Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)

Text Input
<input type="text"> defines a one-line input field for text input:


Radio Button Input
<input type="radio"> defines a radio button.

Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices:


The Submit Button
<input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form’s action attribute:


The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Normally, the form data is sent to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example above, the form data is sent to a page on the server called “/action_page.php”. This page contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

<form action=”/action_page.php”>

The Method Attribute
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data:

<form action=”/action_page.php” method=”get”>

or

<form action=”/action_page.php” method=”post”>
