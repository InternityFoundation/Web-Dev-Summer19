Pseudo-classes


A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button’s color when the user’s pointer hovers over it.

Syntax
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
:hover
The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).


:visited
The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons, the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited.


:active
The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, “activation” typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.


:focus
The :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard’s “tab” key.


:link
The :link CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has not yet been visited. It matches every unvisited <a>, <area>, or <link> element that has an href attribute.
