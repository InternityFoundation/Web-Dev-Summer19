The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

Basic example:
This simple example draws a green rectangle onto a canvas.

HTML File:


JS File:


The Document.getElementById() method gets a reference to the HTML <canvas> element. Next, the HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method gets that element’s context?—?the thing onto which the drawing will be rendered.

The actual drawing is done using the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The fillStyle property makes the rectangle green. The fillRect() method places its top-left corner at (10, 10), and gives it a size of 150 units wide by 100 tall.

Result:


Drawing text:
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])?—?Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])?—?Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

A fillText example:
The text is filled using the current fillStyle.



A strokeText example:
The text is filled using the current strokeStyle.
