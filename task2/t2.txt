html:-
The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements.

Doctype:-
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.
HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

Base:-
the <base> tag specifies the base URL/target for all relative URLs in a document.

link:-
The <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource.
The <link> tag is used to link to external style sheets.

Meta:-
Metadata is data (information) about data.
The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.
Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.


head:-
The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.
The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.

Style:-
The <style> tag is used to define style information for an HTML document.
Inside the <style> element you specify how HTML elements should render in a browser.
Each HTML document can contain multiple <style> tags

Script:-
The <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content

Noscript:-
The <noscript> tag defines an alternate content for users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support script.
The <noscript> element can be used in both <head> and <body>.
