    <div class="col" style="background-color: gray;">An operations manager working at a Supermarket chain in India knows about the amount of preparation the store chain needs to do before the Indian festive season (Diwali) kicks in. It is for them to estimate/predict which product will sell like hotcakes and which would not prior to the purchase.
