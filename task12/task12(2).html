<p>    <span>hasan Raza</span><br> With focus now centred on Shikhar Dhawan’s recovery from a left-thumb injury, Sridhar threw light on how the opener’s fielding standards need to be assessed too when he returns. “He stands in the slips in the initial phase of the innings.  That can be an issue. We will test him with lighter balls first and gradually move on to the cricket ball and see how it goes from there but yeah that will be a challenge,” Sridhar said.</p>

    Asked about his squad’s fielding standards, Sridhar lauded the squad’s attitude: “I am very happy with the resources. We have a terrific slip catcher in Rohit (Sharma) and we have two guys, Virat (Kohli) and (Ravindra) Jadeja, who are very intimidating. To complement that, we have Hardik Pandya, who can really help. We also saw (Yuzvendra) Chahal and (Jasprit) Bumrah crack it up in the last game, diving after bowling long spells. The biggest thing was the attitude of the fielders, where they put the team ahead of themselves”
