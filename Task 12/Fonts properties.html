<center><h1>Internity About Us</h1>
<p class="b">With a belief "Together we can" to make you "Change ready" with a responsibility that<br>

"My Job is everybody gets it" <br>

An initiative is taken to transform the learning system of India - Internity</p></center>
<p class="a">This community rises to fill the hidden gaps which a student experience in the learning methodologies. The talent of the students in the colleges do not get a way out to explore and excel due to these hidden gaps like lack of guidance, resources, exposure, their learning environment, the tendency of resisting any change even for their betterment. The team has come up with a structure to let the students achieve what they have dreamt of.

The learning cannot be uplifted just by enrolling a structure, it requires practice and efforts of the students. The structure will make the students change ready to face the upcoming challenges. We believe that together we can make the Indian learning system a platform where every student has the chance to showcase his/her talent.
